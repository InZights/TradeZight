## üöÄ Project Overview

TradeZight is an AI-powered Streamlit application designed to empower traders and investors with comprehensive, data-driven insights. In today's volatile financial markets, making informed decisions requires synthesizing vast amounts of information. TradeZight addresses this challenge by intelligently fusing two critical data streams: **candlestick chart analysis** and **financial news sentiment**.

The app provides actionable trade suggestions, complete with precise numerical guidance (entry points, profit targets, support/resistance, stop-losses), all presented in a clear, easy-to-digest tabular format. A dedicated AI chatbot is also integrated to answer specific trading-related questions based on the generated analysis.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Visual Chart Analysis:** Upload a candlestick chart (PNG, JPG, JPEG) and let AI analyze its patterns, trends, and key signals (e.g., Bullish Engulfing, MACD Crossover, RSI indicators).
* **News Sentiment Analysis:** Input relevant financial news text, and the AI will analyze its sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) and provide a confidence score and reasoning.
* **Multi-Modal Fusion:** The core innovation! TradeZight intelligently combines insights from both visual chart analysis and news sentiment to generate a holistic trade suggestion.
* **Actionable Numerical Guidance:** The fusion summary provides concrete numbers for:
    * Suggested Entry Points/Ranges
    * Potential Profit Targets
    * Key Support Levels
    * Key Resistance Levels
    * Recommended Stop-Loss Levels
* **Concise Rationale:** Each trade suggestion is accompanied by a brief, clear explanation of the contributing factors from both technical and fundamental (sentiment) perspectives.
* **AI Trading Assistant Chatbot:** A dedicated sidebar chatbot allows users to ask follow-up questions about the analysis, trade strategies, or market conditions, receiving context-aware responses.
* **Persistent Results:** Analysis results are stored in session state, preventing redundant API calls and ensuring a smooth user experience even across app reruns.
